        <h4>> What it is?</h4>
        <p>This is a "project" where I decided to plant trees using the website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.treedom.net/">Treedom.net</a> with 10% of the bounties I get.
          You can check out all of the already planted trees in the #bugs4trees forest by clicking the button below.</p>

        <div class="forest_button">
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.treedom.net/en/user/david-schtz/event/bugs4trees">check out the forest</a>
        </div>

        <h4>> How does it work?</h4>
        <p>
          <i>tree_budget</i> - Amount that will be used to buy trees<br/>
          <i>tree_type</i> - A type of tree on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.treedom.net/en/plant-a-tree?types=tree">treedom.net</a><br/>
          <i>available_types</i> - Plantable <i>tree_type</i>s, excluding last planted type</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I recieve a bounty</li>
          <li>10% of the bounty will be <i>tree_budget</i></li>
          <li>I randomly select 4 <i>tree_type</i>s from <i>available_types</i></li>
          <li>A poll on Twitter will be created with the 4 <i>tree_type</i>s</li>
          <li>You can vote for which type of tree to plant</li>
          <li>After voting is over, I'll buy (<i>tree_budget</i> / <i>tree_type_price</i>) amount of trees of the voted <i>tree_type</i>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        <h4>> What is Treedom?</h4>
        <p>On Treedom you can plant trees with money. This concept is not necessarily new. There are multiple things where I think Treedom differs from the rest:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They delibaretly gamify the whole process. It's inspired by the game FarmVille.</li>
          <li>When you buy a tree, it's "yours". You can view it's exact location and you'll get a picute of it when it's planted. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.treedom.net/en/user/david-schtz/trees/VWY-J3Z">Like this one.</a></li>
          <li>It's a lot of small communities / farmers planting the trees rather then one bigger organization.</li>
          <li>Most of the plantable trees are fruit trees or similar, which will provide food & economic benefeits to the farmer in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more detaild infomration, you can check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.treedom.net/pdf/methodology/treedom-methodology-02-treedom-standard-en.pdf">Treedom Standard</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.treedom.net/pdf/methodology/treedom-methodology-01-ethical-code-en.pdf">Code of Ethics</a>. These are the rules of for the farmers/people involved.</p>
        <p><b>TLDR:</b> I don't think it's a scam.</p>
